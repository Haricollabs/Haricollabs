## Hi there 👋 I'm Hari


- I'm a Data Engineer focused on Databricks and Azure Data Services–centered solutions currently. I have soaked my hands in both OLTP and OLAP solutions . I have good exposure to the Life Sciences & Bio-Pharma domain 🧬, and the BFSI domain is in my bucket list to work on 💼📊. 

- I’ve been playing with PySpark and SQL all along & love doing that 💻. I’ve always loved Databricks as an all-in-one centralized platform ✨.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Data Engineering projects involving End-to-End soltions. (Especially projects utilizing cleansed data to build AI/ML solutions)
