## Hi there 👋 I'm Hari


I'm a Data Engineer focused on Databricks and Azure Data Services–centered solutions currently. I have soaked my hands in both OLTP and OLAP solutions . I have good exposure to the Life Sciences & Bio-Pharma domain 🧬, and the BFSI domain is in my bucket list to work on 💼📊. 

I’ve been playing with PySpark and SQL all along & love doing that 💻. I’ve always loved Databricks as an all-in-one centralized platform ✨.

In a recent engagement with a Bio-Pharma–based project, I worked as an independent developer to successfully deliver an OLAP system for marketing data exploration 📈🔍.

I'm always open to learning new skills as what better today might get outdated if not updated. Not a perfect guy, but a guy working everyday to become what he dreams of and the journey continues 🌱🛤️
